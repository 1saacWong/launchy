Reworking:
    URI will determine launcher
    calculate host_os
    calculate ruby_engine

    spawner, determined by host_os and ruby engine:

    lookup host_application, which will be by host_os and have a cascading order
    of:
        ENV['LAUNCHY_BROWSER'] - these are all just commandlines
        ENV['BROWSER']
        built in list based upon host_os

    for all of these:
        have open in tab/window
        sub '%s' out
